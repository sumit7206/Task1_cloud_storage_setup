Task 1: Cloud Storage Setup
In this task, I set up and configured a cloud storage bucket using Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3. A uniquely named bucket was created in the US East (N. Virginia) region. I uploaded sample files and configured access permissions to allow public viewing. Due to Bucket Owner Enforced settings, I applied object-level ACL permissions to make the files publicly accessible. This hands-on activity enhanced my understanding of cloud storage architecture, access control mechanisms, and permission management in a real-world cloud environment.
